# Navel-Microbes-Analysis

The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset catalogs microbes colonizing human navels. https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/ The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Analyses are performed using this dataset https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json
